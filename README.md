# Project-DVT-Car_Claims

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing car claims data to derive insights and patterns that can help improve decision-making in the insurance industry. We aim to identify fraudulent claims, reduce processing time, and predict potential risks.

# Key Objectives:
Fraud Detection: Analyze claim patterns to flag potentially fraudulent claims.
Risk Prediction: Identify high-risk claimants using predictive modeling.
Cost Analysis: Evaluate claims to understand cost drivers and optimize payouts.

# Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Database: SQL
- Visualization Tools: Tableau

 # Data Source
The car claims data is sourced from the XYZ Insurance Company and contains the following attributes:

- Claim ID: Unique identifier for each claim.
- Policyholder: Information about the insured individual.
- Claim Amount: Total claim amount filed.
- Fraudulent: Binary indicator (Yes/No) for whether the claim is suspected to be fraudulent.

  # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our EDA involved visualizing patterns in the data to understand relationships between various features like claim amount, frequency, and fraud status.
Hereâ€™s a sample visualization from our analysis:
